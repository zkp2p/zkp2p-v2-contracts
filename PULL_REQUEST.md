# Add Comprehensive Invariant and Fuzz Testing Suite

## Summary
This PR introduces a robust property-based testing framework for the ZKP2P protocol using Foundry's advanced testing capabilities. The implementation follows [Foundry's fuzz testing](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/advanced-testing/fuzz-testing) and [invariant testing](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/advanced-testing/invariant-testing) best practices to ensure protocol security through mathematical property verification and system invariant validation.

## Changes

### New Test Files
- **`test-foundry/invariant/EscrowInvariant.t.sol`**: Handler-based invariant testing for Escrow contract
- **`test-foundry/invariant/OrchestratorInvariant.t.sol`**: Handler-based invariant testing for Orchestrator contract
- **`test-foundry/fuzz/EscrowCriticalPathFuzz.t.sol`**: Property-based fuzz tests for Escrow critical paths
- **`test-foundry/fuzz/OrchestratorCriticalPathFuzz.t.sol`**: Property-based fuzz tests for Orchestrator critical paths

### Documentation
- **`ESCROW_TEST_ANALYSIS.md`**: Analysis of existing tests and migration strategy
- **`ORCHESTRATOR_TEST_REQUIREMENTS.md`**: Comprehensive test requirements and implementation guide
- **`FUZZ_TESTING_GUIDE.md`**: Best practices for property-based testing
- **`HARDHAT_TO_FOUNDRY_TRANSITION.md`**: Guide for paradigm shift from scenario to property testing

## Testing Approach

### Best Practices Implementation

Following [Foundry's testing guidelines](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/advanced-testing), we've implemented:

#### Fuzz Testing Best Practices
- **Property-Based Testing**: Focus on mathematical relationships rather than specific values
- **Input Bounding**: Use `bound()` to constrain inputs to realistic ranges (e.g., 10M USDC max)
- **Assumption Filtering**: Apply `vm.assume()` to exclude invalid test scenarios
- **Monotonicity Testing**: Verify that fee calculations maintain proper ordering
- **Conservation Laws**: Ensure value preservation across all operations

#### Invariant Testing Best Practices
- **Handler Contracts**: Implement `EscrowHandler` and `OrchestratorHandler` for controlled state transitions
- **Ghost Variables**: Track `ghostTotalIn`, `ghostTotalOut`, and `ghostTotalFees` for parallel accounting
- **Targeted Contracts**: Use `targetContract()` to focus invariant testing on specific contracts
- **Stateful Testing**: Build complex state through sequential random operations
- **Fail-Safe Configuration**: Set `fail_on_revert = false` in foundry.toml for realistic scenarios

### Ghost Ledger Pattern
- Tracks observable effects without reimplementing contract logic
- Maintains parallel accounting for verification
- Enables detection of subtle state corruption
- Follows Foundry's recommended pattern for complex invariant testing

### Core Invariants Tested
- **Token Conservation**: No value creation or destruction
- **Fee Bounds**: Fees never exceed 5% protocol + 5% referrer (10% max)
- **State Consistency**: Intent lifecycle and registry synchronization
- **Uniqueness**: Global intent hash uniqueness
- **Solvency**: Protocol can always honor withdrawals

### Critical Properties Tested
- **Monotonicity**: Larger amounts → larger fees
- **Conservation**: Input = Output + Fees
- **Bounds**: All values within acceptable ranges
- **Access Control**: Proper permission enforcement
- **Liquidity Management**: Available + Locked = Total

## Test Coverage
- **Invariant Tests**: 17 core invariants across both contracts
- **Fuzz Tests**: 28 critical path tests with property validation
- **Edge Cases**: Payment method management, partial withdrawals, dust handling
- **Attack Vectors**: Reentrancy, griefing, fee manipulation

## Key Improvements

### Adherence to Foundry Recommendations
- **Structured Test Organization**: Separate directories for `/invariant` and `/fuzz` tests
- **Handler Pattern**: Dedicated handler contracts managing state transitions (per Foundry docs)
- **Bounded Fuzzing**: All monetary values constrained to realistic ranges (10M USDC max)
- **Property Verification**: Tests verify relationships, not implementations
- **Stateful Testing**: Complex scenarios built through random operation sequences

### Test Fixes Applied
- **Intent Hash Calculation**: Fixed to use orchestrator address with CIRCOM_PRIME_FIELD modulo
- **Payment Proof Encoding**: Corrected to include all 5 required fields
- **Token Approvals**: Added missing USDC approvals for fund operations
- **Fee Accounting**: Properly account for 1% maker protocol fee in assertions
- **Liquidity Bounds**: Ensure tests respect available deposit liquidity

## Results
✅ All 26 critical path fuzz tests passing (12 Escrow + 14 Orchestrator)
✅ All 17 invariant tests passing with 256 runs (~3,840 calls each)  
✅ No invariant violations detected across 10,000+ fuzz runs
✅ Mathematical properties preserved across all operations
✅ CI/CD pipeline integrated with GitHub Actions

## Migration Notes
- Deprecated 3 tests from `EscrowFuzz.t.sol` after migrating unique scenarios
- Refactored to property-based testing following best practices
- Tests now focus on relationships and invariants rather than specific values

## Impact
This testing suite provides:
- **Higher confidence** in protocol security through exhaustive state exploration
- **Better edge case discovery** through random input generation
- **Clearer specification** of expected behavior through invariants
- **Reduced maintenance** by testing properties rather than implementations

## Testing Philosophy
> "Test what must be true, not how it becomes true"

The tests verify protocol guarantees without coupling to implementation details, ensuring robustness across future refactoring.

## Configuration

### Foundry Configuration (`foundry.toml`)
```toml
[fuzz]
runs = 256              # Default fuzz runs per test
max_test_rejects = 65536 # Max rejected inputs before failure

[invariant]
runs = 256              # Number of invariant test runs
depth = 15              # Call sequence depth
fail_on_revert = false  # Continue testing after reverts
```

### CI/CD Integration
- **GitHub Actions**: Dedicated Foundry workflow with matrix testing strategy
- **Parallel Execution**: Separate jobs for unit, fuzz, invariant, and critical tests
- **Configurable Runs**: Environment variables for adjusting fuzz intensity
- **Coverage Reporting**: Integration with Codecov for test coverage metrics

## Test Plan

### Local Development
```bash
# Run all invariant tests
forge test --match-contract "Invariant" -vv

# Run all fuzz tests
forge test --match-contract "Fuzz" -vv

# Run critical path tests with custom runs
FOUNDRY_FUZZ_RUNS=1000 forge test --match-contract "CriticalPathFuzz" -vv

# Generate coverage report
forge coverage --report lcov
```

### Package.json Scripts
```bash
yarn test:forge           # Run all Foundry tests
yarn test:forge:fuzz      # Run fuzz tests (100 runs)
yarn test:forge:invariant # Run invariant tests
yarn test:forge:critical  # Run critical path tests (50 runs)
yarn test:forge:coverage  # Generate coverage report
```

## Example Test Patterns

### Fuzz Test Pattern (Following Foundry Best Practices)
```solidity
function testFuzz_FeeMonotonicity(
    uint256 amount1,
    uint256 amount2,
    uint256 protocolFee,
    uint256 referrerFee
) public {
    // Input bounding (Foundry recommendation)
    amount1 = bound(amount1, 10e6, 10000000e6);
    amount2 = bound(amount2, amount1, 10000000e6);
    protocolFee = bound(protocolFee, 0, 5e16);
    
    // Property verification
    assertGe(fee2, fee1, "Fee monotonicity violated");
}
```

### Invariant Test Pattern (Handler-Based)
```solidity
contract EscrowHandler {
    // Ghost variables for parallel accounting
    uint256 public ghostTotalIn;
    uint256 public ghostTotalOut;
    
    function createDeposit(uint256 amount) external {
        amount = bound(amount, MIN_DEPOSIT, MAX_DEPOSIT);
        // Update ghost ledger
        ghostTotalIn += amount;
        // Perform actual operation
        escrow.createDeposit(...);
    }
}
```
