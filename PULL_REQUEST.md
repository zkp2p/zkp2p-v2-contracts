# Add Comprehensive Invariant and Fuzz Testing Suite

## Summary
This PR introduces a robust property-based testing framework for the ZKP2P protocol using Foundry's invariant and fuzz testing capabilities. The tests focus on verifying mathematical properties and system invariants rather than specific implementations, significantly improving test coverage and catching edge cases that traditional unit tests might miss.

## Changes

### New Test Files
- **`test-foundry/invariant/EscrowInvariant.t.sol`**: Handler-based invariant testing for Escrow contract
- **`test-foundry/invariant/OrchestratorInvariant.t.sol`**: Handler-based invariant testing for Orchestrator contract
- **`test-foundry/fuzz/EscrowCriticalPathFuzz.t.sol`**: Property-based fuzz tests for Escrow critical paths
- **`test-foundry/fuzz/OrchestratorCriticalPathFuzz.t.sol`**: Property-based fuzz tests for Orchestrator critical paths

### Documentation
- **`ESCROW_TEST_ANALYSIS.md`**: Analysis of existing tests and migration strategy
- **`ORCHESTRATOR_TEST_REQUIREMENTS.md`**: Comprehensive test requirements and implementation guide
- **`FUZZ_TESTING_GUIDE.md`**: Best practices for property-based testing
- **`HARDHAT_TO_FOUNDRY_TRANSITION.md`**: Guide for paradigm shift from scenario to property testing

## Testing Approach

### Ghost Ledger Pattern
- Tracks observable effects without reimplementing contract logic
- Maintains parallel accounting for verification
- Enables detection of subtle state corruption

### Core Invariants Tested
- **Token Conservation**: No value creation or destruction
- **Fee Bounds**: Fees never exceed 5% protocol + 5% referrer (10% max)
- **State Consistency**: Intent lifecycle and registry synchronization
- **Uniqueness**: Global intent hash uniqueness
- **Solvency**: Protocol can always honor withdrawals

### Critical Properties Tested
- **Monotonicity**: Larger amounts → larger fees
- **Conservation**: Input = Output + Fees
- **Bounds**: All values within acceptable ranges
- **Access Control**: Proper permission enforcement
- **Liquidity Management**: Available + Locked = Total

## Test Coverage
- **Invariant Tests**: 17 core invariants across both contracts
- **Fuzz Tests**: 28 critical path tests with property validation
- **Edge Cases**: Payment method management, partial withdrawals, dust handling
- **Attack Vectors**: Reentrancy, griefing, fee manipulation

## Results
✅ All invariant tests passing with 256 runs (~3,840 calls each)
✅ Critical path fuzz tests validating properties with 1000+ runs
✅ No invariant violations detected
✅ Mathematical properties preserved across all operations

## Migration Notes
- Deprecated 3 tests from `EscrowFuzz.t.sol` after migrating unique scenarios
- Refactored to property-based testing following best practices
- Tests now focus on relationships and invariants rather than specific values

## Impact
This testing suite provides:
- **Higher confidence** in protocol security through exhaustive state exploration
- **Better edge case discovery** through random input generation
- **Clearer specification** of expected behavior through invariants
- **Reduced maintenance** by testing properties rather than implementations

## Testing Philosophy
> "Test what must be true, not how it becomes true"

The tests verify protocol guarantees without coupling to implementation details, ensuring robustness across future refactoring.

## Test Plan
```bash
# Run all invariant tests
forge test --match-path test-foundry/invariant/* -vv

# Run all fuzz tests
forge test --match-path test-foundry/fuzz/* -vv

# Run with higher fuzz runs for thorough testing
FOUNDRY_FUZZ_RUNS=10000 forge test --match-path test-foundry/fuzz/* -vv
```
